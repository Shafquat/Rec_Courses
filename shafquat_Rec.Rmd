The Git Repo for this notebook is [Rec Courses](https://github.com/Shafquat/Rec_Courses). When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

The first step is to set the working directory and load the data

```{r}
setwd("~/R/20-03-18 PFR Data")

# load data
library("readxl")
rec_data <- read_excel('recreational-courses-historical-data-2015.xlsx' , sheet = 1)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
rec_data
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
